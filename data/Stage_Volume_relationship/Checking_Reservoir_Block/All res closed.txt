ADVISORY : CDiagPeriod: :EvaluationPeriod CalibAndValid: the evaluation period is only partially covered by the simulation period. Diagnostics will not indicate performance over entire evaluation period specified.
ADVISORY : CModel::InitializeBasins: one or more subbasin reference discharges were autogenerated from annual average runoff
ADVISORY : Because no processes with CANOPY_SNOW variable have been specified, all snow interception will be directly moved to the atmosphere as if it had sublimated.
SIMULATION COMPLETE :)
